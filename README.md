# AlgorithmAnalysis

Hi! These were my projects in the course "Algorithm Analysis" in my 4th year of University

Project 1: A simple program that counts how many times the room light was turned on as people enter and leave the room.

Project 2: Greedy "Activity Selection"

Project 3: Dynamic "Knapsack 0-1"

All this solutions were made by Fabián Cid and Rodolfo Fariña.

Year 2020, 1st semester, 4th year
