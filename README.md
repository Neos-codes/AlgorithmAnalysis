# AlgorithmAnalysis

Hi! These were my projects in the course "Algorithm Analysis" in my 4th year of University

Project 1: A simple program that counts how many times the room light was turned on as people enter and leave the room.

Project 2: This program resolves the "Activity Selection" problem with a greedy solution.

Project 3: This program resolves the "Knapsack 0-1" problem with dynamic programming.

All this solutions were made by Fabián Cid and Rodolfo Fariña.
